# Project Standards

## General Guidelines

- **Read AGENTS.md first** — It contains vendor-neutral instructions for all AI tools
- **Consistency** — Match existing patterns in the file you're editing
- **Incremental changes** — Prefer small, focused edits over large refactors unless requested

## Before Committing

- Run the project's test suite
- Ensure no secrets or credentials are in the diff
- Verify lint/format passes

## Error Handling

Handle errors explicitly; avoid silent failures:

```python
# BAD
try:
    result = fetch_data()
except:
    pass

# GOOD
try:
    result = fetch_data()
except FetchError as e:
    logger.error("Failed to fetch", extra={"error": str(e)})
    raise
```

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to public functions and classes
- Update README when adding new services or changing setup
- Comment non-obvious logic; avoid commenting the obvious

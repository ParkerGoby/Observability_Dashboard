# Microservice Patterns

When working with microservices in this project:

## Service Boundaries

- Each service should be independently deployable
- Prefer HTTP/REST or message queues for inter-service communication
- Avoid shared databases between services; use APIs or events

## Configuration

- Load config from environment variables
- Use `.env.example` as a template; never commit `.env`
- Validate config at startup (fail fast if required vars are missing)

## API Design

- Use consistent URL patterns: `/api/v1/resource`
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error payloads with clear messages and optional codes
